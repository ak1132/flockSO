# flockOS
FlockSo is an app that seamlessly integrates StackOverflow into the Flock environment. It lets users query StackOverflow questions and provide them with most relevant solutions. It also allows users to subscribe to questions, and have a bot conveniently notify them of any activity on that question. 

This is extensible enough to easily integrate with any StackExchange platform.
